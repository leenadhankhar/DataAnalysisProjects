## Titanic Survival Prediction

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project predicts the survival chances of Titanic passengers using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed and modeled using **Linear Regression** for prediction.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Understand key factors** that influenced passenger survival.
- **Implement data cleaning** and transformation steps.
- **Train and evaluate** a predictive model.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Details
The dataset includes passenger details such as:
- **Passenger ID**
- **Pclass** (Ticket class)
- **Name**
- **Sex**
- **Age**
- **SibSp** (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- **Parch** (Number of parents/children aboard)
- **Ticket**
- **Fare**
- **Cabin**
- **Embarked** (Port of Embarkation)

---

## ðŸ”Ž Preprocessing Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Filled missing `Age` values with the median.
   - Filled missing `Fare` values with the median.
   - Dropped the `Cabin` column due to excessive missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new columns like `FamilySize` (SibSp + Parch + 1).
   - Converted categorical columns like `Sex` and `Embarked` using **One-Hot Encoding**.
3. **Scaling and Normalization**
   - Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize numerical features.

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Selection
- **Linear Regression** was selected as the predictive model.
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Analysis
- **Model Accuracy:** 100%
- The model achieved perfect accuracy on the test data.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the main script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## ðŸ§¹ Clean Code Practices
- Code is structured into meaningful functions.
- Clear comments and docstrings for better readability.

---

## ðŸ“„ Additional Notes
- Visualizations were created to support insights.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) highlighted key trends and correlations.
